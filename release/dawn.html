					My first EP, marking the start of my Arnavd project. I called it "Dawn" because it was the EP symbolizing the dawn of my project.<br/>
					For the cover art, I was hugely inspired by the cover of "Adieu" by Tchami, so I decided to make a cover art with the same look, but using a picture I took of the Piton de la Fournaise, the volcano in the Reunion Island.<br/>

					<h3>Tracklist</h3>

					<h4>Tribe</h4>
					<p>
						For this music, I decided to make a music with a percussion-oriented melody, inspired by "Lifted" by Dustycloud. With the melody set, I decided to use an african voice sample on top of it and call it "Tribe", because it made me think of some african tribe melody (a little bit clich√© isn't it ?).
					</p>
					<p class="song-infos">
						Length: 4:33 &nbsp; BPM: 123 &nbsp; Key: ??
					</p>

					<h4>Fade</h4>
					<p>
						For this one, I wanted to make a basic Tech House song, with only a small melody repeating every 4 bars using a nice synth. Unfortunately, I was pretty bad at making Tech House at this time, so the bassline is just one note repeating each beat and there aren't a lot of drums.
					</p>
					<p class="song-infos">
						Length: 4:13 &nbsp; BPM: 125 &nbsp; Key: ??
					</p>

					<h4>Make It Hot</h4>
					<p>
						For the last song of the EP, I decided to use a full vocal sample, used all throughout the song. I then used a pluck synth to make a repeating melody following the progression of the vocals.

						Length: 3:51 &nbsp; BPM: 127 &nbsp; Key: ??
